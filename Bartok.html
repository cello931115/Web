<strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUG5fYLSC8w" target="_blank" title="The best of Bartok Musik">Béla Viktor János Bartók</a></strong> (/ˈbeɪlə ˈbɑːrtɒk/; Hungarian: Bartók Béla, pronounced [ˈbɒrtoːk ˈbeːlɒ]; 25 March 1881 – 26 September 1945) was a <u>Hungarian composer</u>, pianist, and ethnomusicologist. He is considered one of the most important composers of the 20th century; he and Franz Liszt are regarded as <strong>Hungary's greatest composers</strong>(Gillies 2001). Through his collection and analytical study of folk music, he was one of the founders of comparative musicology, which later became ethnomusicology.<br>

<br><h3>Childhood and early years (1881–98)</h3>
<p>Bartók was born in the Banatian town of Nagyszentmiklós in the Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Sânnicolau Mare, Romania) on 25 March 1881.<br>Bartók had a diverse ancestry. On his father's side, the Bartók family was a Hungarian lower noble family, originating from Borsodszirák, Borsod (Móser 2006a, 44). His paternal grandmother was a Catholic of Bunjevci origin, but considered herself Hungarian (Szekernyés 2017). Bartók's father was also named Béla; although his mother, Paula (née Voit), had ethnic German roots, she spoke Hungarian fluently (Hooker 2001, 16). She was a native of Turócszentmárton (present-day Martin, Slovakia) (Cooper 2015, 6). Paula also had Hungarian (Teréz Fegyveres) and Slavic (Polereczky: Magyarized Slavic (Anon. & n.d.(c))) ancestors.[citation needed]</p>
